# RTSP Camera Streaming to Chromecast

Stream an RTSP-enabled camera to Chromecast with Google Assistant integration.

> Hey Google, show the _Front Yard_ camera on the _Kitchen TV_

where _Front Yard_ is a camera with an RTSP stream (that doesn't natively support Chromecast or Google Assistant) and _Kitchen TV_ is a chromecast.

This is a work-in-progress.
